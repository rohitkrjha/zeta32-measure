/-! The numerical constant of the finite-piece route (the proof notes, §8.5).

* `midRat` = Σ over the 196 relaxed pieces of `a_J |J| + b_J (x₂² − x₁²)/2` (exact rational; one kernel `decide`
  per block of at most 10 pieces, about 200 rational operations each);
* `log (140/3) > 3842/1000` from `log 2 > 0.6931471803` and eight terms of the series of `log (1 − 13/48)`;
* `tailConst/20 + midRat + 35/36 − (25/4)·(3842/1000) < 283/50`.

The rational `midRat + tailConst'/20 + 35/36` with the addendum's tail constant is `Q_lean` of
results/lean-route-A.out; here the tail constant is `33/5 + 121/2000` (slightly weaker than `33/5 + 28/500`,
see `psiL_le_tail`). -/
