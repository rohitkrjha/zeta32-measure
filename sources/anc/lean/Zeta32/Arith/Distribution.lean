/-! the proof notes, §1, Lemma 1 and Corollary 2.

Route change: the Tate-algebra distribution formula is not
formalized. The local bounds it served (the proof notes, Lemma 3, Lemma 4) are proved directly by
class-wise partial fractions: `Zeta32.Arith.Local.VG_polynomialMoment` (Local/Binom.lean,
the polynomial part of `U_r`), `Zeta32.Arith.Local.VG_res`, `VG_polyPart_eval`
(Local/PoleFun.lean) and `Zeta32.Arith.Local.Lfun_GV` (Local/Entry.lean). -/
