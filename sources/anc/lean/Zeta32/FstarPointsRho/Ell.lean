/-! Uniform bound `ℓ(a) ≤ −159/100` on `[a₋, a₊]`.
`ℓ = 2log(a/2) + (1/3)J₀ + (4/3)J₁ − (1/3)J₅` with `J₀ = −a`, `J₁ = −log(2/(1+U₁)) − (U₁−1)`,
`J₅ = −5log(10/(5+U₅)) − (U₅−5)`, `U_c = √(c²+a²)`. Each term is bounded separately by monotonicity in `a`
(`U₁ ∈ [2647/1250, 105881/50000]`, `U₅ ∈ [266853/50000, 533707/100000]`), the three logs by `log_le`/`log_ge'`.
Upper bound obtained: `−1.60135`. Data: `tools/b2_numerics.py`. -/
